- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @GreenDino3000. It's not my real name...obviously. I am a broke (ex?) college student who's simply trying to figure out what he's going to do in life.

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in making a game. The game idea is as follows: You are in command of a gunship, a la the AC-130 gunship. The game is built on the fundamental principles of around 2-3 games, though I do not intend to outright copy these games; Zombie Gunship (ZG) and Zombie Gunship Survival (ZGS).

- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zombie-gunship-survival/id1019161597 : ZGS

- All of these can be downloaded on both IOS and Android so you may see what they are about. 

- I also have a text file which will explain what distinguishes these games from each other and what my own game seeks to achieve. Principally, it will not be dominated by the problems of the freemium model as I simply detest it. This will be a PC game that I plan to release on steam as a product you can get...not on mobile, and never with a freemium model. 

- Basically, you get the progression you work for, at the fun, fair pace you'd expect of a normal game. I'm not in this for the money; this is a passion project. So I plan to ultimately release the game for free (and with mod support, if I can get that).

- Let that be held against me if I go against my word.

- As for development time, I do not have a clear idea of when this will be completed. However, it will be a multi-year long project, absolute minimum of 2 years with a lot of magic and elbow grease, but realistically it would be more along the lines of 4.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning unity(3d) and C#. This is partly "on the road" learning; I do not have a job involving coding, I am not working on this project as a real job. This is a probject I am doing in my spare time, I simply learn as I develop the game via the power of YouTube and Google, and participate in Unity forums/discussion areas that have helped me out. As such, at any given point, there will probably be a lot of things I do not know. If I'm handed a piece of a code in a structure or way I don't understand, I'm not unwilling to learn it, but I'll probably need at least an hour familiarizing myself with the concept before I can really start putting it to use.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm willing to collaborate with anyone who feels interested in helping with the development of the game (such as assets I can quickly put into the game and test). Admittedly, I do not have the funds to pay for this work in any meaningful sense, so this would be purely anyone who comes to me to volunteer to work on something. I will not ask anyone to do more than what they want, or do something I would not attempt to implement myself, nor something they are unfamiliar with.

- I do however ask that if someone volunters because they truly wish to see the project through that they are at least somewhat timely with whatever task(s) they take up. Week long tasks shouldn't take a month, and it shouldn't take a week to get a finished result to me.

- Once you have completed the task, you will have to provide your (real) name, wherein I will record the task and what aspect of development it fits into. You will be given due credit for whatever you finish and provide to me, I will make sure of that, even if I have to write it down on an actual piece of paper.

- üì´ How to reach me: I have an email address, but I admittedly do not use it that much. To make things easier, simply go onto my discord and say that you wish to help.
